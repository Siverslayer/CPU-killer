# CPU Killer

The CPU Killer is a tool designed to stress and overload the CPU of a computer system, simulating high computational loads for testing, benchmarking, or stress testing purposes.

## Introduction

The CPU Killer tool is used to put heavy computational loads on the CPU, causing it to operate at maximum capacity for extended periods. This can be useful for testing the stability and performance of computer systems under extreme conditions, identifying cooling or power supply issues, or evaluating the effectiveness of thermal management solutions.

## Features

- **CPU Stress Testing:** Generate intense computational workloads to stress-test the CPU and assess its performance under heavy loads.
- **Customizable Workloads:** Configure the intensity and duration of CPU stress tests to simulate specific usage scenarios or test conditions.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitor CPU utilization, temperature, and other performance metrics in real-time during stress testing.
- **Multi-threaded Execution:** Utilize multiple CPU cores and threads to maximize CPU utilization and simulate multi-threaded workloads.
- **Graphical Interface:** Provide a user-friendly graphical interface for configuring stress tests, monitoring system performance, and analyzing results.

## Usage
Run it as administrator

## Warning

Running CPU stress tests can cause system instability, overheating, or hardware damage if not performed carefully. It is important to monitor system temperatures and performance metrics closely during stress testing and ensure adequate cooling and power supply for the system under test.
